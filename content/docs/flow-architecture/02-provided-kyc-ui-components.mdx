## Start a new verification

Redirect users to the hosted UI to begin the zKYC verification process.

## Document submitions
Users submit an identity document of their choice for verification. The document is analyzed to ensure its authenticity and to detect potential forgery.

## Facematch
After submitting the document, the user is required to take a photo of their face. This image is matched against the portrait extracted from the previously submitted document.

## Liveness check
To confirm that the user is a real, living person, a liveness check is performed. This step prevents fraud attempts using static images or automated systems.

## Waiting responce
Once all verification steps are completed, the KYC request is submitted and processed by our backend.
Processing time typically ranges from 1 to 15 minutes.

## Received proof
After successful verification, the user can download their zKPass proof as a JSON file.

## Proof verification
Users who already possess a valid zKPass proof can verify their identity without repeating the zKYC submission process on any platform that supports zKYC verification.

Note: zKPass proofs are not permanent. They remain valid only while the associated identity document is still valid.
