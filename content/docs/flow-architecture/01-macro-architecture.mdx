## End-to-end lifecycle

1. User starts verification in the secure zKYC environment.
2. zKYC performs document + facematch + liveness checks.
3. A reusable proof linked to the users identity is issued to the user and only the user.
4. The proof is hashed and stored so that the users can verify their identity without the need for a new KYC submition.
5. After the proof is collected the user is redirect to the success page created by the zKYC clients.

### zKPass Proofs

Proofs are small digital confirmations that show a verification was successful. They don’t contain personal documents or sensitive information. Instead, they act like a receipt that anyone can check to confirm the result.
This means you can prove compliance and trustworthiness without exposing user data, keeping privacy fully protected.
