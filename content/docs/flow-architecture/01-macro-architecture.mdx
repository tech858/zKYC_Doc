## End-to-end lifecycle

1. User starts verification in the secure zKYC environment.
2. User is redirected to the zKYC webpage
3. zKYC performs document + facematch + liveness checks the it is submitted to our backend.
4. zKYC back-end return the response of the submition that could valid or invalid.
5. If the KYC response is invalid user is redirected to the failure page.
6. If the KYC response is valid the zKpass proof is generated and given to the user.
7. The proof is hashed and stored off-chain.
8. The zKYC process is complete and the user redirected to the success page.

### zKPass Proofs

Proofs are small digital confirmations that show a verification was successful. They don’t contain personal documents or sensitive information. Instead, they act like a receipt that anyone can check to confirm the result.
This means you can prove compliance and trustworthiness without exposing user data, keeping privacy fully protected.
