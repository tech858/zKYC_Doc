### 4. Payments and Subscriptions
Our services are offered on a subscription basis. By subscribing to our services, you agree to pay the applicable fees. All fees are non-refundable, except as required by law. We reserve the right to change our fees at any time, and we will provide you with notice of any fee changes.
