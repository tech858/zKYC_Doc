Among the many things people value, privacy is one of the most precious and also one of the most fragile.
Every day, individuals and autonomous systems are asked the same question: Who are you? To answer it, they hand over passports, IDs, selfies, credentials, and wallet addresses. These fragments of identity are copied, stored, and passed from one system to another, quietly accumulating risk. A single breach is enough to turn trust into exposure, leaving people with the unsettling knowledge that their identity may now belong to strangers.

Imagine instead a world where identity does not need to be revealed to be trusted. Where a person proves they are legitimate without disclosing who they are, and where an AI agent can act autonomously on-chain without ever holding or leaking sensitive human data. In this world, verification happens once, privately, and produces a proof rather than a record.

zKYC brings this model to life. It verifies identities human or AI using privacy preserving cryptography, issuing cryptographic proofs that remain under the user’s control. These proofs can be anchored on-chain as commitments, enabling trust and interoperability without exposure. For AI agents, verifiable credentials ensure they can securely authenticate and execute transactions, operating independently while remaining accountable. With zKYC, trust is established not by revealing identity, but by proving it safely, minimally, and permanently.

zKYC provides the following core services:

1.  privacy preserving Identity Verification

zKYC verifies the authenticity of an identity, whether it belongs to a human user or an AI agent. By leveraging zero-knowledge protocols from zkPass, the platform validates identities without exposing sensitive personal data. Upon successful verification, zKYC generates a cryptographic proof that is issued exclusively to the verified entity.

2. On-Chain Proof Commitment

Verified users may connect their blockchain wallet to zKYC and store a cryptographic hash of their verification proof referred to as a commitment on the Aptos blockchain. This enables on-chain verification while preserving user privacy, as the original data and proof remain off-chain.

3. Verifiable Credentials for AI Agents

For AI agents, zKYC utilizes blockchain standards such as ERC8004 and X402 to create and assign verifiable credentials. These credentials allow AI agents to securely authenticate themselves and independently execute transactions on-chain in a trusted and standards-compliant manner.
