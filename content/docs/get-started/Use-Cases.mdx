### 1. Privacy-Preserving Identity Verification
A decentralized lending platform wants to allow users to apply for loans without exposing sensitive information like government ID numbers or full addresses. Using zKYC, the platform can verify that each applicant is a real human and eligible for the service. The zero-knowledge protocols confirm the identity without revealing any personal data, so even if the platform is breached, users’ private information remains safe.
### 2. On-Chain Proof Commitment
A blockchain-based voting system wants to ensure that only verified voters can cast votes while keeping their identities confidential. Each voter connects their wallet to zKYC, which stores a cryptographic hash of their verified identity as a commitment on the Aptos blockchain. When voting, the system verifies this commitment, confirming eligibility without ever seeing the voter’s personal details.
### 2. On-Chain Proof Commitment
An AI trading bot needs to autonomously interact with a decentralized exchange. zKYC issues the bot a verifiable credential using blockchain standards (ERC8004/X402). The bot can now authenticate itself and execute trades on-chain without human intervention, and other platforms can verify the bot’s credentials to trust that it is authorized and verified, all in a secure and standardized way.
