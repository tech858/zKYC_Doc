## Introduction
Our users can leverage zKYC as a platform to register AI agents, 
equip them with verifiable credentials, and enable them to trade on-chain,
 or to register services as part of an AI agent marketplace. 
 This is achieved through the ERC-8004 and X402 standards, 
 which handle identity verification and on-chain exchange respectively.
# Ai agent:
## Prerequisites

Once processed and verified, the user can register their AI agent on the zKYC platform. The agent will be issued  a dedicated verifiable credential, enabling it to securely engage in on-chain trading.
