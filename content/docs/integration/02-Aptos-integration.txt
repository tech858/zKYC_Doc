## Introduction
Among the many things people value, privacy is one of the most precious—and also one of the most fragile.
In today’s digital world, personal data is constantly collected, stored, and shared.
A single breach can permanently expose an individual’s identity, despite regulations designed to protect it, creating a fear that everyone shares: that our private information could one day fall into the hands of strangers.

zKYC was conceived to solve this problem.
It is a platform that validates the authenticity of an identity, whether belonging to a human user or an AI agent.
Leveraging zero-knowledge protocols, zKYC verifies a user’s identity without exposing sensitive data and generates a cryptographic proof that is issued exclusively to the user.
Additionally, the user can connect their Keplr wallet and store the hash of their proof (called a commitment) on the Aptos blockchain.
For AI agents, zKYC uses blockchain standards ERC8004 and X402 to create and assign verifiable credentials, enabling agents to securely execute transactions on-chain.
